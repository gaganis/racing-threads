# Ready, Set, GO! Putting Threads to Race lightcycles in the JVM. Getting to a lock-free implementation

This repository contains the set of programs I implemented in Java using
'racer' Threads, locking and lock-free concepts that models
the imaginative scenario of Tron LightCycles racing against
each other. 

I wrote these while trying to learn more about lock free
programming in Java and I have described them in more detail
in a post on my blog [here](https://giorgosgaganis.com/2016/12/12/ready-set-go-putting-threads-to-race-lightcycles-in-the-jvm-getting-to-a-lock-free-implementation/)
